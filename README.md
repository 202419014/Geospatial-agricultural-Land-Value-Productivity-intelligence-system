# 🌾 AgriLand Value Intelligence System
### Geospatial Agricultural Land Value & Productivity Intelligence — Ludhiana District, Punjab

> AI-powered land valuation platform built with Streamlit, Random Forest ML, Folium maps, and real geospatial data from SoilGrids & APMC market datasets.

---

## 📌 What This Tool Does

AgriLand Value Intelligence helps **farmers** and **land buyers** in Ludhiana District, Punjab assess and explore agricultural land prices using machine learning. Users log in via OTP, select their role (Farmer / Buyer), and access an interactive map of 36+ land parcels with ML-predicted valuations based on real soil and market data.

**Key capabilities:**
- 🗺️ Interactive Folium map — click any parcel to see price, soil quality, and market proximity
- ✏️ Draw your own parcel boundary and get an instant ML price estimate
- 🌱 Soil feature extraction (clay, sand, silt, pH, organic carbon, nitrogen) from raster data
- 🏪 Market proximity scoring using APMC mandi locations
- 🤖 Random Forest model with feature importance explanations
- 📊 Filterable summary table of all land parcels

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO_NAME.git
cd YOUR_REPO_NAME
```

### 2. Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

> ⚠️ Requires Python 3.9+. It is strongly recommended to use a virtual environment:
> ```bash
> python -m venv venv
> source venv/bin/activate        # macOS/Linux
> venv\Scripts\activate           # Windows
> pip install -r requirements.txt
> ```

### 3. Run the App
```bash
streamlit run main.py
```

The app will open automatically at **http://localhost:8501**

### 4. Login (Demo Mode)
- Enter any 10-digit mobile number (e.g. `9876543210`)
- Click **Send OTP** — the OTP will appear on screen (SMS disabled in demo)
- Enter the OTP and choose your role: **Farmer** or **Buyer**

## 🗃️ Sample Data

The `data/` folder contains a small ready-to-use dataset so instructors can run the tool immediately:

- **36 land parcels** in Ludhiana District with price, soil type, irrigation status
- **APMC market locations** (CSV + GeoJSON) for proximity computation
- **Soil rasters** for clay, sand, silt, pH, organic carbon, nitrogen extraction

The Random Forest model (`rf_model.pkl`) is auto-generated on first run if not present.
